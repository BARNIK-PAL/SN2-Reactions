A comprehensive data of electronic structure predictions has been generated and analyzed for the family 
of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions:  
<p align="center";">$\ce{CH3X + F^- -> CH3F + X^-}$, where X= (F, Cl, CN, OH, SH NH<sub>2</sub>).</p>  
The aim of the study is :

1. To find the relative stabilities of the reactant and products with HF, DFT (B3LYP) and MP2 at 6-
31+G(d) basis set.
2. Comparison of reaction enthalpies (âˆ†H) of the aforesaid S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions with experimental numbers.
3. To find the forward and backward barrier of the reactions at MP2/6-31+G(d) level.\

The above figure shows the energy diagram for a protoypical gas-phase S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. All relevant reactants, products, and transition states, optimized geometries, and relative energies were 
computed. In this study, HF, MP2 and B3LYP methods were utilized with 6-31+G(d) basis set for geometric structure determinations.
